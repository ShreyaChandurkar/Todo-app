# Todo-app

Hello, my name is Shreya Chandurkar. I am currently pursuing my master's degree in Master of Computer Application. As part of my coursework, I have developed an assignment that includes several features.

Firstly, I have created a registration form with validation and error pop-ups. The registration form ensures that the entered information meets the required criteria.

Secondly, I have developed a login form with validation and error pop-ups as well. This form ensures that only authorized users can access the system.

Additionally, I have implemented a to-do list feature. The to-do list displays a list of assignments that need to be completed. The list is divided into three categories: "All Todos," "Active Todos," and "Done Todos."

Under the "All Todos" tab, all assigned tasks are displayed. This allows users to have an overview of all the tasks they need to complete.

Under the "Active Todos" tab, only the tasks that are yet to be completed are displayed. This provides users with a clear view of their pending assignments.

Under the "Done Todos" tab, all the tasks that have been completed are displayed. This allows users to track their progress and review their completed work.

To further enhance the functionality, I have included a "Remove Done Todos" button. Clicking this button will delete all the completed tasks in a single click, providing a convenient way to manage completed assignments.

This application is built using the MERN stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. These technologies work together to provide a robust and efficient development environment.

For your reference, I have attached screenshots of all the screens to provide a visual representation of the application.
